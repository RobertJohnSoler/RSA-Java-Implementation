# RSA-Java-Implementation

This projects implements the entire RSA cryptosystem from scratch. It goes from using Fermat's primality test to generate prime numbers, to encrypting and decrypting messages using RSA.

There are two main folders in this repo. The `/Proof_of_concepts` folder contains basic proof-of-concept files for basic functions that make up the RSA implementation. These codes serve as the building blocks to the actual implementation of the RSA algorithm in Java. Basic explanations of the program logic are also in these files.

However, if you want to see the actual implementation of the RSA cryptosystem, then the folder `/Actual_implementation` is the right one for you. There are a few use cases and an actual simulation in this folder, all of which showcase how the RSA algorithm is used in keeping a conversation private.
